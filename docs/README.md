## Curriculum Overview

### Curriculum Ethos
The following courses were designed with the mindset of helping people understand how technology can be used for social good. In today's age, exponential developments in technology are presenting just as many amazing innovations as alarming concerns. It becomes the individual's responsibility to address them, educate themselves about the science of the matter, and collaborate with others to continuously solve these problems.

Network effects are the key to navigating a world with such rapidly expanding information access and as such, students should keep a particular learning goal in mind when going through the material by considering the following framework:
- A **Level 1 Understanding** of a particular topic will let you confidently say to yourself “I get it” and call it a day. You can now recall the material next week or next month and comfortably reaffirm to yourself that you still understand what you had learned
- A **Level 2 Understanding** indicates a strong enough comprehension that by articulating and explaining the topic you can successfully pass on a Level 1 Understanding of the topic to someone else
- A **Level 3 Understanding** represents a certain mastery of both the topic and the ways it is taught, that you can successfully pass on a Level 2 Understanding to someone else

The point here is that ideally this curriculum should not only help trigger those “aha!” moments, but also inspire students to reinforce their learning with a Level 2 Understanding and become teachers themselves, creating exponential effects and spreading the most relevant information.

### SetLife Courses
1. [Fundamentals of Software (v1.0 released)](https://education.setlife.network/Fundamentals-of-Software)
2. Discovering & Verifying Digital Information
3. Project Planning & Development
4. Cybersecurity, Blockchains, & Trusted Computing


#### Fundamentals of Software (FS)
This course is best suited for newcomers to the world of programming. In Part 1, student will establish a foundational understanding of the basic logical principles that govern the behavior of a program. Part 2 will feature actual coding and language-specific syntax and should only be introduced after the fundamental foundation has been set. This will help students reinforce these principles in practice and start building a familiarity for reading and writing source code.

#### Discovering & Verifying Digital Information (DVDI)
This course is aimed at improving students' ability to discover and verify digital information. As the virtually limitless amount of information available on the internet continues to grow into new forms and sizes, one of the most critical components of software literacy includes becoming proficient in finding high quality information. This demands a strong scientific methodology for ensuring that corrupted information is not incorporated into your work and research. 

#### Project Planning & Development (PPD)
This course provides key insights for those who have specialized their skillset in design, marketing, or programming and want to gain a more holistic understanding of the software development process. Project managers may also find some of the material helpful for reinforcing their knowledge and adapting parts of their own management methods.

#### Cybersecurity, Blockchains, & Trusted Computing (CBTC)
Part 1 will teach basic ways to assess exposure to common risks that affect anyone using the software of the Internet. Part 2 will dive deeper into the more specific vulnerabilities currently present in critical components of Internet infrastructure, introducing blockchain as a networking protocol and outlining the general principles that govern any trusted relationships required for different kinds of computing.
